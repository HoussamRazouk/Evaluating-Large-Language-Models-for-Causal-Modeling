Fibromyalgia,"['Connective Tissue Disorder', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,"The text 'Fibromyalgia' does not describe the simultaneous occurrence of the causal variables 'Connective Tissue Disorder' and 'Genetics'. Fibromyalgia is a separate condition that can be influenced by genetics and may co-occur with connective tissue disorders, but it is not an interaction value of these two variables."
COL5A1 Variants in these genes have been linked to an increased risk of Achilles tendon injury,"['Connective Tissue Disorder', 'Genetics']",False,True,data created by annotators,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,"The text describes a genetic variant (COL5A1 Variants) that is linked to an increased risk of Achilles tendon injury, which is a type of connective tissue disorder. Therefore, the text belongs to both causal variables and describes an interaction value."
Muscle twitching,"['Neuromuscular Fatigue', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,"The text 'Muscle twitching' does not provide information on both 'Neuromuscular Fatigue' and 'Genetics'. Therefore, it cannot be considered as an interaction value for these variables."
FTO is linked to increased body mass and weight gain but the effect can be mitigated by physical activity.,"['Neuromuscular Fatigue', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,"The text mentions the FTO gene, which is a genetic factor, but it does not mention neuromuscular fatigue. Therefore, the text only belongs to one of the causal variables, which is 'Genetics'."
Running,"['Warm Up Exercises', 'Contact sport']",True,False,data created by annotators,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,"The text 'Running' does not belong to both causal variables 'Warm Up Exercises' and 'Contact sport'. Running can be a part of warm up exercises, but it is not a warm up exercise itself. Also, running is not necessarily a contact sport."
Torn ligaments,"['Tissue Weakness', 'Injury']",True,True,data created by annotators,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,The text 'Torn ligaments' describes a situation where both causal variables are present. 'Tissue Weakness' is implied as the ligaments would not have torn if they were not weak. 'Injury' is explicitly mentioned as 'Torn ligaments'.
