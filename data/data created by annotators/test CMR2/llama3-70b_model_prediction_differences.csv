Fibromyalgia,"['Connective Tissue Disorder', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,llama3-70b,,The text 'Fibromyalgia' is a disease name and does not describe the simultaneous occurrence of values of multiple causal variables.
COL5A1 Variants in these genes have been linked to an increased risk of Achilles tendon injury,"['Connective Tissue Disorder', 'Genetics']",False,True,data created by annotators,llama3-70b,,The text describes the relationship between COL5A1 Variants (Genetics) and the increased risk of Achilles tendon injury (Connective Tissue Disorder)
Muscle twitching,"['Neuromuscular Fatigue', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,llama3-70b,,"The text 'Muscle twitching' does not simultaneously describe different values of both 'Neuromuscular Fatigue' and 'Genetics' variables, hence it is not an interaction value."
FTO is linked to increased body mass and weight gain but the effect can be mitigated by physical activity.,"['Neuromuscular Fatigue', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,llama3-70b,,"The text does not mention Neuromuscular Fatigue, and only mentions Genetics indirectly through the gene FTO, but not explicitly as a variable."
Running,"['Warm Up Exercises', 'Contact sport']",True,False,data created by annotators,llama3-70b,,The text 'Running' does not describe simultaneous values of both 'Warm Up Exercises' and 'Contact sport' variables.
Torn ligaments,"['Tissue Weakness', 'Injury']",True,True,data created by annotators,llama3-70b,,"The text 'Torn ligaments' implies that there is an injury (Injury: Yes) and the tissue is weak (Tissue Weakness: Yes), hence it is an interaction value."
