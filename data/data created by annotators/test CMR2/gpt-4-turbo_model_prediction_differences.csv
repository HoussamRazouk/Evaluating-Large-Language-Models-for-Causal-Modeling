Fibromyalgia,"['Connective Tissue Disorder', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,gpt-4-turbo,,"The text 'Fibromyalgia' refers to a specific medical condition but does not explicitly mention or describe values related to 'Connective Tissue Disorder' or 'Genetics'. Therefore, it cannot be considered as providing simultaneous occurrence values for these variables."
COL5A1 Variants in these genes have been linked to an increased risk of Achilles tendon injury,"['Connective Tissue Disorder', 'Genetics']",False,True,data created by annotators,gpt-4-turbo,,"The text describes the genetic variable 'COL5A1 Variants' and its impact on a specific connective tissue disorder, 'Achilles tendon injury'. Both causal variables are simultaneously addressed in the context of genetic predisposition leading to a physical health outcome."
Muscle twitching,"['Neuromuscular Fatigue', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,gpt-4-turbo,,"The text 'Muscle twitching' does not explicitly mention or imply values for both 'Neuromuscular Fatigue' and 'Genetics'. It could be related to 'Neuromuscular Fatigue' as a symptom, but there is no direct reference to 'Genetics'. Therefore, it does not describe simultaneous occurrence values of the given causal variables."
FTO is linked to increased body mass and weight gain but the effect can be mitigated by physical activity.,"['Neuromuscular Fatigue', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,gpt-4-turbo,,"The text mentions 'FTO', which is related to genetics, affecting body mass and weight. However, it does not discuss 'Neuromuscular Fatigue'. Therefore, it does not cover all provided causal variables simultaneously."
Running,"['Warm Up Exercises', 'Contact sport']",True,False,data created by annotators,gpt-4-turbo,,The text 'Running' does not explicitly describe the simultaneous occurrence of 'Warm Up Exercises' and 'Contact sport'. Running could be a part of warm up exercises but it is not necessarily a contact sport.
Torn ligaments,"['Tissue Weakness', 'Injury']",True,True,data created by annotators,gpt-4-turbo,,"The text 'Torn ligaments' implies an injury, specifically to ligaments, which can be caused by or result in tissue weakness. Thus, it relates to both variables 'Tissue Weakness' and 'Injury'."
