Fibromyalgia,"['Connective Tissue Disorder', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,gpt-3.5-turbo,,The text 'Fibromyalgia' does not belong to both causal variables 'Connective Tissue Disorder' and 'Genetics'. It is a specific condition and does not describe values of the provided variables simultaneously.
COL5A1 Variants in these genes have been linked to an increased risk of Achilles tendon injury,"['Connective Tissue Disorder', 'Genetics']",False,True,data created by annotators,gpt-3.5-turbo,,"The text describes a direct link between genetics (COL5A1 variants) and an increased risk of Achilles tendon injury, which falls under the 'Genetics' variable. However, it does not mention anything about Connective Tissue Disorder, so the value for that variable is left empty."
Muscle twitching,"['Neuromuscular Fatigue', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,gpt-3.5-turbo,,"The text 'Muscle twitching' does not provide values for both 'Neuromuscular Fatigue' and 'Genetics' simultaneously. It only describes a symptom related to muscle activity, which does not directly indicate values for the specified causal variables."
FTO is linked to increased body mass and weight gain but the effect can be mitigated by physical activity.,"['Neuromuscular Fatigue', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,gpt-3.5-turbo,,"The text mentions 'increased body mass and weight gain' which are related to genetics (FTO gene), but it also introduces 'physical activity' as a mitigating factor, which is not related to the provided variables Neuromuscular Fatigue and Genetics. Therefore, the text does not belong to all causal variables simultaneously."
Running,"['Warm Up Exercises', 'Contact sport']",True,False,data created by annotators,gpt-3.5-turbo,,The text 'Running' does not belong to all causal variables simultaneously. It does not provide values for both 'Warm Up Exercises' and 'Contact sport'.
Torn ligaments,"['Tissue Weakness', 'Injury']",True,False,data created by annotators,gpt-3.5-turbo,,"The text 'Torn ligaments' specifically refers to an 'Injury' (torn ligaments) and does not provide information about 'Tissue Weakness'. Therefore, it does not belong to both causal variables simultaneously."
