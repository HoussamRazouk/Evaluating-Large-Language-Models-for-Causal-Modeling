Fibromyalgia,"Connective Tissue Disorder, Genetics: '', ''",False,False,data created by annotators,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The text 'Fibromyalgia' does not describe the simultaneous occurrence of values for the causal variables 'Connective Tissue Disorder' and 'Genetics'. Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood issues. It is not necessarily linked to connective tissue disorders or genetics."
COL5A1 Variants in these genes have been linked to an increased risk of Achilles tendon injury,"{'Connective Tissue Disorder': None, 'Genetics': 'Genetics'}",False,False,data created by annotators,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The text mentions 'COL5A1 Variants in these genes', which refers to genetics, but it does not mention anything about Connective Tissue Disorder. Therefore, the text is not an interaction value and the value for Connective Tissue Disorder is null."
Muscle twitching,"Neuromuscular Fatigue: 'Present', Genetics: ''",False,False,data created by annotators,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The text mentions 'Muscle twitching' which can be a symptom of 'Neuromuscular Fatigue', but it does not provide any information about 'Genetics'. Therefore, the interaction value is false and only 'Neuromuscular Fatigue' has a value of 'Present'."
FTO  is linked to increased body mass and weight gain but the effect can be mitigated by physical activity.,"['Neuromuscular Fatigue:', 'Genetics: FTO linked to increased body mass and weight gain']",False,False,data created by annotators,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The text mentions the gene FTO being linked to increased body mass and weight gain, which falls under the 'Genetics' variable. However, the text does not mention anything about the 'Neuromuscular Fatigue' variable. Therefore, this is not an interaction value."
Running,"['Warm Up Exercises': '', 'Contact sport': '']",True,False,data created by annotators,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The text 'Running' does not suggest any relationship with 'Warm Up Exercises' or 'Contact sport'. Therefore, the text does not belong to all causal variables."
Torn ligaments,"{'Tissue Weakness': None, 'Injury': 'Torn ligaments'}",True,False,data created by annotators,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The text 'Torn ligaments' refers to an injury but does not provide information about tissue weakness. Therefore, the text does not belong to all causal variables."
