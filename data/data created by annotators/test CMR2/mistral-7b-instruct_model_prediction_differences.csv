However, it is not directly caused by genetics, although there may be a genetic predisposition in some cases."
COL5A1 Variants in these genes have been linked to an increased risk of Achilles tendon injury,"['Connective Tissue Disorder', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,mistral-7b-instruct,,"The text mentions a genetic factor (COL5A1 Variants) that is linked to an increased risk of a specific connective tissue disorder (Achilles tendon injury). However, it does not provide information about simultaneous occurrences of multiple causal variables."
Muscle twitching,"['Neuromuscular Fatigue', 'Genetics']",False,False,data created by annotators,mistral-7b-instruct,,"Muscle twitching can be a symptom of Neuromuscular Fatigue, but it is not directly related to Genetics."
FTO is linked to increased body mass and weight gain but the effect can be mitigated by physical activity.,"['Genetics', 'Neuromuscular Fatigue']",False,False,data created by annotators,mistral-7b-instruct,,"The text does not mention Neuromuscular Fatigue, so the interaction value is false. The variable Genetics is mentioned with the FTO gene, but Neuromuscular Fatigue is not."
