"conflict, psychological","['conflict', 'infectious disease']",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,"The text 'conflict, psychological' only provides a value for the variable 'conflict' and does not provide a value for the variable 'infectious disease'. Therefore, this text does not describe the simultaneous occurrence values of multiple causal variables."
pestilence,"['conflict', 'infectious disease']",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,"The term 'pestilence' refers to a deadly or virulent epidemic disease, which aligns with the variable 'infectious disease'.

However, it does not describe the simultaneous occurrence of all three causal variables - 'looting', 'demonstration', and 'protest'. Therefore, it is not an interaction value."
demonstration,"['looting', 'demonstration', 'protest']",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,"The text 'demonstration' only belongs to one of the causal variables, which is 'demonstration'. Therefore, it does not describe the simultaneous occurrence of different values of different causal variables."
workplace accident,"['work accident', 'regime change']",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,"The text 'workplace accident' belongs to the causal variable 'work accident' but does not belong to the causal variable 'regime change'. Therefore, it is not an interaction value."
revolution,"['work accident', 'regime change']",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,"The text 'revolution' does not describe simultaneous occurrence values of the causal variables 'work accident' and 'regime change'. It only refers to a general concept of revolution, which could be interpreted in various ways, but does not inherently imply a work accident or a regime change."
military conflict,"['armed conflict', 'war']",True,True,wikicausal,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,The term 'military conflict' can be considered as an interaction value for both 'armed conflict' and 'war' variables.

helicopter crash,"['aircraft crash', 'aviation accident']",True,True,wikicausal,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,"The text 'helicopter crash' belongs to both causal variables 'aircraft crash' and 'aviation accident'.

outbreak,"['epidemic', 'disease outbreak']",True,True,wikicausal,mixtral-8x22b-instruct,,"The term 'outbreak' is a synonym for both 'epidemic' and 'disease outbreak'. Therefore, the text 'outbreak' belongs to both causal variables and is an interaction value."
