despoiling,"['', '', '']",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The word 'despoiling' does not have a clear association with any of the provided causal variables: 'looting', 'demonstration', or 'protest'.

The text 'demonstration' does belong to the variable 'demonstration', but since it is not an interaction value, the value for this variable is also set to 'demonstration'."
workplace accident,"{'work accident': 'workplace accident', 'regime change': ''}",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The text 'workplace accident' does not mention 'regime change', so it is not an interaction value."
revolution,"{'work accident': '', 'regime change': 'revolution'}",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The text 'revolution' does not imply any relationship to work accidents, but it can be considered as a value for the variable 'regime change'."
military conflict,"{'armed conflict': 'yes', 'war': ''}",True,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The term 'military conflict' can be an instance of 'armed conflict', but it does not necessarily mean a 'war' as it can also refer to smaller scale military actions.
