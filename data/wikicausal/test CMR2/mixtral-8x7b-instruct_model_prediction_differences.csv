Text,Variables,Generated Interaction value,Predicted Interaction value,Data Generation Model,Prediction Model,Domain,Explanation
"conflict, psychological","['conflict':'present', 'infectious disease':''",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The text mentions the presence of 'conflict' but does not mention any 'infectious disease'. Therefore, the text is not an interaction value."
pestilence,"{'conflict': '', 'infectious disease': 'pestilence'}",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The term 'pestilence' is commonly associated with an infectious disease, but it does not necessarily imply the presence of a conflict. Therefore, the text does not describe the simultaneous occurrence of different values for both causal variables."
despoiling,"['', '', '']",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The word 'despoiling' does not have a direct relationship with 'looting', 'demonstration', or 'protest'. Despoiling generally refers to the act of ruining or destroying something. Therefore, it does not describe the simultaneous occurrence of different values of the given causal variables."
demonstration,"['demonstration': 'true', 'looting': '', 'protest': '']",False,True,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The term 'demonstration' is present in the given text and is also one of the variables. However, the text does not mention 'looting' or 'protest', so their values are set to ''. The Predicted Interaction value is true because the text does contain one of the variables."
workplace accident,"{'work accident': 'workplace accident', 'regime change': ''}",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The text 'workplace accident' does not mention 'regime change', so it is not an interaction value."
revolution,"['', 'revolution']",False,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The text 'revolution' does not describe a work accident, but it does describe a regime change. Therefore, it is not an interaction value, and the value for 'work accident' is ''. The value for 'regime change' is 'revolution' because the text describes a revolution, which is a type of regime change."
military conflict,"{'armed conflict': 'true', 'war': ''}",True,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The term 'military conflict' has a direct relationship with the variable 'armed conflict'. However, it does not necessarily imply the occurrence of 'war'. Therefore, the text does not describe the simultaneous occurrence of different values of multiple causal variables."
helicopter crash,[],True,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The text 'helicopter crash' does not belong to both causal variables 'aircraft crash' and 'aviation accident'. It is more specific and refers to a particular type of aircraft. Therefore, the variables' values are set to empty strings []."
outbreak,[''],True,False,wikicausal,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,,"The term 'outbreak' does not specifically refer to an 'epidemic' and does not provide enough information to determine if it is a 'disease outbreak'. Therefore, the variables are assigned empty string values."
