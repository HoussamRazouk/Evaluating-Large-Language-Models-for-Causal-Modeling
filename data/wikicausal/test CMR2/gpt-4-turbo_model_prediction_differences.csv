"conflict, psychological","['conflict', 'infectious disease']",False,False,wikicausal,gpt-4-turbo,,"The text 'conflict, psychological' only provides information related to the 'conflict' variable, specifying it as psychological. There is no information about the 'infectious disease' variable."
pestilence,"['conflict', 'infectious disease']",False,False,wikicausal,gpt-4-turbo,,"The term 'pestilence' specifically refers to a fatal epidemic disease, which aligns with the causal variable 'infectious disease'. However, it does not relate to 'conflict', hence it does not cover all provided causal variables simultaneously."
despoiling,"['looting', 'demonstration', 'protest']",False,False,wikicausal,gpt-4-turbo,,"The term 'despoiling' primarily refers to the act of plundering or looting, which directly relates to the variable 'looting'. However, it does not specifically relate to 'demonstration' or 'protest', as these terms imply a public display of opinion, which is not inherently connected to the act of looting or plundering."
demonstration,"['looting', 'demonstration', 'protest']",False,False,wikicausal,gpt-4-turbo,,"The text 'demonstration' specifically refers to only one of the provided causal variables, which is 'demonstration'. It does not simultaneously describe the other variables 'looting' and 'protest'. Therefore, it does not represent an interaction value among all the given variables."
workplace accident,"['work accident', 'regime change']",False,False,wikicausal,gpt-4-turbo,,"The text 'workplace accident' directly corresponds to the variable 'work accident' but does not relate to 'regime change'. Therefore, it does not cover all provided causal variables simultaneously."
revolution,"['work accident', 'regime change']",False,False,wikicausal,gpt-4-turbo,,"The term 'revolution' is more closely related to 'regime change' and does not directly imply a 'work accident'. Therefore, it does not simultaneously describe the occurrence of both variables."
military conflict,"['armed conflict', 'war']",True,False,wikicausal,gpt-4-turbo,,"The term 'military conflict' does not explicitly cover both 'armed conflict' and 'war' as defined variables. While 'military conflict' can be considered a type of 'armed conflict', it does not necessarily imply a 'war', which typically denotes a larger scale or officially declared conflict."
helicopter crash,"['aircraft crash', 'aviation accident']",True,True,wikicausal,gpt-4-turbo,,"The text 'helicopter crash' directly relates to both 'aircraft crash' and 'aviation accident'. A helicopter is a type of aircraft, and its crash is an aviation accident."
outbreak,"['epidemic', 'disease outbreak']",True,True,wikicausal,gpt-4-turbo,,The term 'outbreak' directly relates to both variables 'epidemic' and 'disease outbreak' as it is a synonym or a direct descriptor of these events.
