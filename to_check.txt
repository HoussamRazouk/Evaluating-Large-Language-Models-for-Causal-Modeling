Here is the JSON object with the assessment:

```
{
  "Text1": "mass killing",
  "Text2": "2nd degree murder",
  "Predicted Same Causal Variable": false,
  "Predicted Variable Name": "",
  "Explanation": "Although both texts describe violent or harmful actions, they belong to different categories. 'Mass killing' is a broader term that can refer to various types of mass murder, while '2nd degree murder' is a specific legal term that refers to a particular type of murder. They do not describe the same causal variable."
}
```

In this assessment, I determined that the two texts do not belong to the same causal variable. The reason is that they describe different categories of violent or harmful actions. "Mass killing" is a broader term that can refer to various types of mass murder, while "2nd degree murder" is a specific legal term that refers to a particular type of murder. They do not describe the same causal variable, and therefore, I set the predicted variable name to an empty string.
