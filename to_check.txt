Here is the JSON object with the assessment:

```
{
  "Text1": "mass killing",
  "Text2": "2nd degree murder",
  "Predicted Same Causal Variable": false,
  "Predicted Variable Name": "",
  "Explanation": "Although both texts describe violent or harmful actions, they belong to different categories. 'Mass killing' typically refers to a large-scale killing, often in a short period, whereas '2nd degree murder' is a specific legal term for a type of homicide. They do not share the same underlying causal variable."
}
```

In this case, I did not find a common causal variable between the two texts, as they describe different concepts and categories. While both texts are related to harm or violence, they are distinct and do not share a common underlying variable.
